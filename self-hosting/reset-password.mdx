title: Reset Password
description: Users can reset their password through the terminal of the Plane application. You need to login to backend docker container and run the below command for resetting a user's password.
---
1. Get the container id for **plane-backend**
```
docker ps
``` 

2. Log in to the container
```
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/sh
```

3. Run the reset password command
```
python manage.py reset_password <email>
```
<Tip>
The email should be of an already existing user on the Plane application. If the email is not attached to any user the command will throw an error.
