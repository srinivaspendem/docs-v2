Import issues from your Github repository into Plane.

### GitHub Importer

With Plane's GitHub importer, importing issues from a selected GitHub repository to a chosen project on Plane is just a few clicks away.

This effortless process allows you to conveniently plan and adopt issues into your internal team by utilizing the powerful features of Cycles, Modules, and other tools available on Plane.

### What will be Importing?

We'll map the following fields in GitHub Issues to these fields in Plane:

| **GitHub Issues** | **Plane**   |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Title             | Title       |
| Description       | Description |
| Labels            | Labels      |
| Comments          | Comments    |
